"""Module Cyclops -- stare at cycles in Python data structures.

Cyclops started life as a faster implementation of Lars Marius
Garshol's Plumbo.py, but almost instantly diverged due to feature
bloat.

The only object of real interest is class CycleFinder.  First get an
instance of that:

import Cyclops
z = Cyclops.CycleFinder()

This creates a cycle-tracker with an empty "root set".  Then tell z
which objects you're curious about (more on that later).

After running your regular code, tell z to look for cycles:

z.find_cycles(purge_dead_roots=0)
    Look for cycles reachable from the root set.
    Return 1 if a cycle was found, else 0.
    If optional arg purge_dead_roots is true, first remove objects
    from the root set whose true refcount (exclusive of CycleFinder
    internal references) is 0.
    See also method install_cycle_filter.

Then various methods can be used to get useful reports.  Which are
*most* useful you'll just have to play with.  If you have a few small
cycles, show_cycles is very revealing; if you have many cycles,
show_sccs and show_arcs *may* cut to the heart of the problem quickly.

z.show_stats()
    Print some stats about the last run of find_cycles:  number of
    distinct structured objects reachable from the root set, number of
    distinct objects involved in a cycle, number of cycles found,
    number of strongly connected components, number of objects in the
    root set, and number of edges (graph arcs) examined.

z.show_cycles()
    Print each cycle found to stdout.

z.show_cycleobjs(compare=typename_address_cmp)
    Print a listing of all objects involved in some cycle.  The
    objects are first sorted via the optional "compare" function.  By
    default, sorts first by type name and then by address (id); among
    objects of instance type, sorts by the instances' class names;
    among objects of class type, sorts by the classes' names.

x.show_sccs(compare=typename_address_cmp)
    Print a listing of cycle objects partitioned into strongly
    connected components (that is, the largest groupings possible such
    that each object in an SCC is reachable from every other object in
    that SCC).  Within each SCC, objects are sorted as for
    show_cycleobjs.

z.show_arcs(compare=None)
    Print a listing of all arc types involved in some cycle.  An arc
    is characterized by:
    1) its source object type or class,
    2) the selector (e.g. attribute) from the source, and
    3) its destination object type or class.
    The output is a table with four columns:  count, source, selector,
    destination.  The table is sorted by default on columns 2, 3, 4
    in that order; the first column (count) is ignored.  Specify an
    alternative compare function to change the sort; the compare
    function sees pairs of the form
        ((source_type, selector, destination_type), count)
    where each element of the triple is a string and count is an int.

z.show_obj(obj)
    Print a 2-line description of obj, including its address, adjusted
    refcount, type name and a short representation of its contents.
    See the method docstring for details.

There are two ways to add objects to the root set:

z.run(func, args=(), kwargs={})
    Run func (with optional args and keyword arguments kwargs), adding
    every object initialized by an __init__ function to the root set.
    This is the closest Cyclops gets to plumbo's "lazy" mode.  It's
    factored out here so it can be intermixed with the next method.

z.register(obj)
    Add obj to the root set.

To see the current root set,

z.get_rootset()
    Return the root set, as a list of (rc, cyclic?, obj) tuples.
    See method docstring for details.  In short, rc is the true
    refcount (CycleFinder internal references are subtracted out);
    cyclic is true iff the object is in a known cycle; and obj is the
    object.

Finally, to empty the root set again:

z.clear()
    Empty the root set, and release all other internal references to
    register'ed objects.

Notes:

+ Run Cyclops.py directly to exercise its _test() function; _test()
  sets up some common kinds of cycles, and should be easy to follow.
  Stare at the _test() code and the output until their relationship is
  clear.

+ find_cycles is linear-time, in the number of objects reachable from
  the root set plus the number of arcs connecting them.  This makes
  Cyclops pleasant for "real life" apps with tens of thousands of
  reachable objects, and at least usable well beyond that.

+ A (at least one) reference to each root-set object is maintained
  internally, so roots cannot die before invoking .clear() (or the
  CycleFinder is finalized).  This can distort the truth of your
  program, if a __del__ method of some root object that's not involved
  in a cycle could have caused cycles to get broken (this is unusual,
  but possible!).

  If you suspect it's happening, run find_cycles again passing true
  (optional arg purge_dead_roots):  find_cycles then releases all
  internal refs to root set objects whose true refcount is 0, thus
  allowing their __del__ methods to get invoked.  After that,
  find_cycles chases the remaining root set objects again.  You may
  need several iterations of invoking find_cycles(1) before reaching a
  steady state!

+ By default, cycles are chased through these (& only these) objects:

  - Lists.
  - Tuples.
  - Dicts (both keys and values).
  - Class instances (through their attributes).
  - Classes (through their attributes).
  - Instance method objects (through .im_self and .im_class).

  In particular, modules are not chased.  Maybe they should be.  See
  the next section for a way to force modules to get chased.


CHANGING THE SET OF INTERESTING TYPES

Methods of a CycleFinder object can be used to alter/query its view of
the set of types find_cycles "chases":

z.chase_type(t, t_refs_func, t_tag_func)
    Add type t to the set of interesting types.
    t_refs_func is a function of one argument x, where type(x) is t;
    it should return a sequence (typically a list or tuple) of all
    objects directly reachable from x.
    t_tag_func is a function of two arguments x and i, where type(x)
    is t and i in range(len(t_refs_func(x))).  It should return a
    brief string describing how t_refs_func(x][i] was obtained from
    x.
    See the _XXX_refs and _XXX_tag functions at the start of the
    module for examples of all this.

z.dont_chase_type(t)
    Remove type t from the set of interesting types.  find_cycles
    will not attempt to chase the objects reachable from objects of
    type t.

z.get_chased_types()
    Return the set of interesting types, as a list.


CHANGING THE SET OF INTERESTING CYCLES

Sometimes there are "expected" cycles you would like to ignore; e.g.,
this can happen if you install a module-chaser, because there are
cycles in Python's implementation you typically don't care about (for
example, if your module imports sys, there's a cycle because
sys.modules points back to your module!).

z.install_cycle_filter(filter_func=None)
    filter_func=None -> a way to ignore "expected" cycles.

    filter_func is a function of one argument, a cycle.  Each time
    find_cycles finds a cycle, the cycle is passed to filter_func.  The
    cycle is ignored unless filter_func returns true.  Passing None
    for filter_func restores the default behavior (do not ignore any
    cycle).

    A cycle is a list of (object, index) pairs, where the first object
    in the list is the same as the last object in the list, and where
    the object at cycle[i][0] is the cycle[i][1]'th object obtained
    from object cycle[i-1][0]. cycle[0][1] should be ignored (it tells
    us how we got to the first item in the cycle to begin with, but
    that's irrelevant to the cycle).


CASE STUDY

Below is the driver I used to track cycles in IDLE; it's a replacement
for IDLE's idle.py.

At first it didn't install function or module chasers, or a cycle filter,
and printed everything.  This turned up a bunch of easy cases, and the
show_sccs output was surprisingly revealing (all the cycles fell into a
handful of SCCs, which corresponded to distinct cycle-creating IDLE
subsystems).  show_arcs was also very helpful in getting the big picture.
show_cycles output was too voluminous to be helpful.

After those cycles were broken, the job got harder.  A module chaser was
added, which turned up another class of cycles, and then a function
chaser turned up 100s more.  Most of these involved expected cycles due
to Python's implementation, so a cycle filter was installed to ignore
cycles that didn't contain at least one class instance.  The remaining
cycles were isolated special cases, and only show_cycles output was
of real use.

After all cycles were purged, IDLE was still leaking, so driver output was
added to display the root-set objects still alive at the end.  This turned
up many cases where objects were living only because registration in the
root set was keeping them alive.  So a loop was added to the driver that
repeatedly purges dead root-set objects and tries again.  The __del__
methods of the purged roots caused other root objects to become trash,
and after several iterations of this the output reaches a steady state.

IDLE is still leaking (as of 18-Jul-1999), but ever less so, and while
Cyclops is no longer finding cycles, the driver's "live at the end"
output is still the best clue I've got for guessing what to do next.

Interesting:  At the start of this, it turned out that almost all cycles
were reachable from places outside themselves.  That is, they would not
have been considered trash even if Python used a mark-&-sweep form of
garbage collection.  IDLE's problems, in large part inherited from Tkinter,
are simply that "everything points to everything else".  The good news is
that Guido was able to clean most of this up just by adding reference-
purging code to widgets' explicitly-called destroy() methods.
